# Virtual-Micromouse

The stack that I created holds the elements of the maze, 256 entries.
I wrote a bash script, optional to use but will make your life easier, which will:
1) Compile each file.
2) Link the files.
3) Run the program.
4) Remove the ugly object files.

just run: ./script.sh

Alternatively, use ```make``` and ```./main``` and then ```make clean``` to clean up

You can also push the new changes with ./gitsc.sh
